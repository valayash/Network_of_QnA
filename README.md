# Network of QnA

Hello!
We are group 13 of the course MTH207 in which we have done this project under the guidance of Dr. Dootika Vats
In this project we have Scrap the data from Quora, Stackoverflow and Stackexchange and then we have analysis the data.
We also have make a shiny app.

To run the codes first you have to install the libraries tidyverse, rvest, stringr, ggplot2, plolty and shiny.
Then to run the shiny app you also need to put the datasets in the same working directory where the app is.
Similarly, for the rmarkdown you have to put all the datasets and images in the same working directory where the rmd file is.
